        The 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development is "a plan of action for
        people, planet and prosperity" encompassing economic, social and
        environmental dimensions within 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs).
        Ever Increasing greenhouse gas emissions, growing energy crisis, extreme
        weather events and rapid loss of biodiversity, have taken the shape of a
        global crisis for humanity. Sustainability education has been considered
        as a major catalyst and a transformative agent to find solutions to
        these planetary crises and to make the world a better place to live
        sustainably.

        ICSE was launched in 2019 with the objective to bring out
        the specifics and intricacies of sustainability education as an agent of
        change and transformation in a true sense. The 2nd and 3rd versions of
        ICSE were held virtually to focus on contemporary sustainability
        education issues such as policies, ecosystem restoration and climate
        literacy. The 4th ICSE in 2022 focused on building connections and
        partnerships for a sustainable future to further strengthen the
        much-needed alliance among the community of educators committed towards
        sustainability.

        To encourage collective action in order to address the
        global challenge of climate change, Mobius Foundation is now organizing
        the 5th version of ICSE, on 19-20 September 2023, on the theme,
        ‘Educating for Climate Action and Sustainability’. The conference will
        further build upon and consolidate the experience and strength of the
        network to meaningfully deliberate on the educational imperative of
        climate change and sustainability.
